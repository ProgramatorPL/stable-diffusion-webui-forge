# SD Forge Extra Upscalers

This extension for [Stable Diffusion Web UI Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge) adds support for additional upscalers via [Spandrel](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/spandrel).

## Supported Upscalers

- **ATD**
- **DRCT**
- **MoSR** (requires `spandrel >= 0.4.0`)
- **MoESR** (requires `spandrel >= 0.4.1`)
- **PLKSR**
- **RealPLKSR**
- **RCAN** (requires `spandrel >= 0.4.1`)

## Installation

1. Clone this extension into your `extensions/` directory of SD Web UI Forge. Either using the UI or this command:
```git
git clone https://www.github.com/MisterChief95/sd-forge-extra-upscalers.git
```
2. Restart the Web UI.

## Usage

- Any new upscalers from will appear in the upscaler selection menu when added to the appropriate model directory.
- Select your desired upscaler and process images as usual.

## Configuration

The default setup requires you to create a new folder in your `models` directory with the same name as the upscaler given above.
For example, you would create a new folder named `MoESR` in your `models` directory for any MoESR upscaling models.

#### Settings

Adds options to the `Upscaler` settings section to tweak tile size & overlap for each upscaling model.

#### Model Paths

You can set the directory path for each model type individual through command line args. Example:

```shell
--atd-models-path "./models/new_atd_directory"
```

Just follow the same pattern of `--<model_type>-models-path` and make sure its all lowercase. Only use forward slashes (`/`) in directory paths.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the correct version of Spandrel for all upscalers to function.
- For MoSR, MoESR, and RCAN, check the version requirements above.
